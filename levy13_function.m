% function [func,grad_func] = levy13_function(x);
%
% This is a subroutine that records the gradient of the test problem and
% used to test the performance of CNMGE.
% The test problem comes from [1], and the gradient of the test problem is
% calculated by Hang Xiao and Xinlong Luo.
%
% Input:
% x: It denotes the current x.
%
% Output: 
% func: It denotes the objective function at x. 
%
% grad_func: It denotes the gradient of the objective function at x.
